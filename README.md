My solutions to the Matasano crypto challenges

This is a very part-time project to write code solving the [Matasano crypto challenges](https://cryptopals.com/)

So far it's all been C++, but it seems so long since I really used C++ on a daily basis I wonder about re-implementing it all in Go instead.
